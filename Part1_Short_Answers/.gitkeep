# Part 1: Short Answer Questions

## 1. Problem Definition (6 points)

**Hypothetical AI Problem:**  
Predicting student dropout rates in universities.

**Objectives:**
1. Identify high-risk students early.
2. Reduce dropout rates by 15%.
3. Optimize intervention strategies.

**Stakeholders:**
- University administration.
- Academic advisors.

**KPI:**  
Percentage reduction in student dropout rates.

## 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing (8 points)

**Data Sources:**
1. Student academic records (grades, attendance).
2. Demographic and socio-economic data.

**Potential Bias:**  
Students from marginalized backgrounds may be underrepresented or misrepresented, leading to unfair predictions.

**Preprocessing Steps:**
1. Handle missing data (impute or remove incomplete rows).
2. Normalize numeric features (e.g., grades, attendance).
3. Encode categorical data (e.g., course types, demographic labels).

## 3. Model Development (8 points)

**Chosen Model:** Random Forest

**Justification:**  
- Handles tabular data well.
- Robust to outliers and missing data.
- Provides feature importance for interpretability.

**Data Split:**
- 70% Training
- 15% Validation
- 15% Test

**Hyperparameters to Tune:**
1. `n_estimators` (number of trees) – to balance accuracy and computational cost.
2. `max_depth` – to prevent overfitting.

## 4. Evaluation & Deployment (8 points)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
1. Accuracy – to measure the proportion of correct predictions.
2. F1-Score – to balance precision and recall, important if dropouts are a minority class.

**Concept Drift:**  
Concept drift occurs when data distributions change over time, reducing model accuracy.

**Monitoring Concept Drift:**  
Regularly evaluate model performance on new data; retrain using recent student data periodically.

**Technical Challenge:**  
Scalability of predictions across large student populations while maintaining low latency for real-time interventions.
